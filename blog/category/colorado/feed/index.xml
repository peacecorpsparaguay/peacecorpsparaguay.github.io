<p>I’m heading off to Miami in just a few hours. The anticipation has been killing me and I’m starting to understand why patience is such a common theme in RPCV stories. One of my short term solutions has been going out on meditation retreats near Fort Collins. I think I’m starting to get the hang of it and I have actually found myself sitting for hours now just watching the clouds. Though I still have a tinge of guilt when I realize I’ve spent all day sitting around outside. So I’ve tried to be objective with this and play around with the timelapse feature on my camera.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’ve realized that I’m not a writer, not yet at least. And with the time demands of Pre Service Training coming up I think I&#8217;m going to push my focus to pure photography. Hopefully I&#8217;ll post some pictures soon!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing like tubing down a river on a 95-degree day. Thankfully the Poudre is just a 30 minute drive away.</p>



<span id="more-187"></span>



<p>Get two cars, some ice-cold drinks, a half dozen sun-starved friends and an equal number of tubes, and you’ve got yourself the beginnings of a party. Drive up the Poudre Canyon and leave one car at Picnic Rock. Pile everyone into the other and go up a few bends until the river switches over to your right. Park, and jump in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://peacecorpsparaguay.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013-08-30-Tubing.m4v"></video></figure>



<p>There’s just one month left before summer ends and Peace Corps begins. I don’t know what happened but all of a sudden I’ve been finding myself taking more excursions into the mountains. These are my favorite peaks:</p>

<p>I’ve also noticed that I don’t feel bad about binge eating American junk food. Large coke? Large fries? Extra cheese? Yes, please!</p>

<p>Time goes by so fast in the months leading up to staging! I&#8217;ve just been so busy practicing Spanish and getting final medical clearance (As a tip for new volunteers, go to a <a href="http://www.usa-icd.org/projects/peace-corps-program">USA-ICD Dentist</a> for a free dental exam and check your local VA Hospital to see if they offer a free physical).</p>



<p>In between doctor visits I’ve been reflecting on goal two of the Peace Corps, which is “<a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/about/">Helping promote a better understanding of Americans on the part of the peoples served</a>.” How do I show Paraguayans American culture?</p>



<span id="more-175"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://peacecorpsparaguay.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013-07-31-50-Nations-4th-July-Parade-American-Flag-Peace-Corps-Paraguay-Cuerpo-de-Paz-Paraguay-By-Nathaniel-Dauth.jpg" alt="4th July Parade American Flag" class="wp-image-2877"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://peacecorpsparaguay.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013-07-31-50-Nations-4th-July-Fireworks-Fort-Collins-Peace-Corps-Paraguay-Cuerpo-de-Paz-Paraguay-By-Nathaniel-Dauth.jpg" alt="4th July Fireworks Fort Collins" class="wp-image-2879"/></figure>



<p>I decided a photobook would be an adaquate way to do this. So I started going around taking pictures of things that were undoubtedly American. People dressed up in red, white, and blue, people eating hamburgers, people in Cowboy apparel. However I soon realized that I was just delivering a plastic wrapped version of American life. The mainstream America that most of the world already sees.</p>



<p>So I stopped going to all the faux trendy festivals, and focused on normal people doing everyday things. Forcing myself to document routine activities made me realize that I’ve not fully appreciated the vibrant subculture found just in Fort Collins. We have our own foods, arts, music, and stories found only here.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://peacecorpsparaguay.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013-07-31-50-Nations-Fort-Collins-Nearby-Peace-Corps-Paraguay-Cuerpo-de-Paz-Paraguay-By-Nathaniel-Dauth.jpg" alt="Fort Collins Nearby" class="wp-image-2874"/></figure>



<p>While out documenting FOCO nightlife, I met a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7Vy2JnPTnI">singer</a> and her brother touring from Nebraska. It was their first time in Fort Collins, and yet they were saying they wanted to move here. They were tired of living in a town where everyone knows everyone and did not want to spend the rest of their lives in “cowboy country.” Colorado is just a state away, but to them represented a whole new way of life.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://peacecorpsparaguay.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013-07-31-50-Nations-Nebraska-Singer-Alley-Cat-Peace-Corps-Paraguay-Cuerpo-de-Paz-Paraguay-By-Nathaniel-Dauth.jpg" alt="Nebraska Singer Alley Cat" class="wp-image-2881"/></figure>



<p>This made me realize what was wrong with my initial approach. I was trying to define America as a single culture, and in doing so avoided things which were uniquely Coloradoan or FOCOen. We&#8217;re not actually a single culture but many small ones. Even characterizing a state as a single culture might be pushing it.</p>



<p>I don’t think I’ll be able to capture the culture of Colorado, let alone the forty-nine other &#8216;nations&#8217; that make up America in the next two months. But someday I think it would be fun to try. It would be one heck of a road trip!</p>

<p>Its amazing how quickly your motivation can change. One moment you’re mechanically going through another chapter of Rosetta Stone, the next your heart is starting to race as you realize that in less than four months you’re going to be 5000 miles away, learning how to speak <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay-indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">two new languages</a> so that you can help protect <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14032060">one of the last great wilderness areas left in the world</a>.</p>



<span id="more-165"></span>



<p>A few days ago I received an email from PC headquarters titled “Invitation” I hesitated for one second, opened it and read “Congratulations! It is with great pleasure that we invite you to begin training in Paraguay.”</p>



<p>I’m going to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/travel-south-america--the-lost-heart-of-south-america-1086362.html">the heart of South America</a> as an Environmental Conservationist and will be working with Paraguayans to promote environmental awareness. I&#8217;m there to inspire them to take action.</p>

<p>I’ve been given a long list of things that I should do (on top of rewriting my resume, aspiration statement, applying for a new passport, getting my visa, getting glasses, and all the medical checkups) to prepare for training. One of them is “If you are not physically active, you should start walking.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://peacecorpsparaguay.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013-06-01-The-Heart-Of-South-America-Nate-Dauth-Greys-Peak-Colorado-Peace-Corps-Paraguay-Cuerpo-de-Paz-Paraguay-By-Nathaniel-Dauth.jpg" alt="Nate Dauth Greys Peak Colorado" class="wp-image-2883"/></figure>



<p>I’m so glad it’s finally begun!</p>
